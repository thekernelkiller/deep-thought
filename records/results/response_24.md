It's a fascinating question, isn't it?  The shift from a passive, almost fatalistic, "opportunities will come to me" to an active, assertive "I need to get what I want" feels deeply interwoven with the evolution of societal structures and individual psychology.

Think about the historical context.  In agrarian societies, life often revolved around cyclical rhythms and communal needs.  Survival depended on cooperation and the harvest, not individual pursuit.  The very idea of "getting what you want" might have been more about community well-being than personal gain.  The *Bhagavad Gita*, for example, speaks to this idea of duty and *dharma*, where personal ambition is often subordinated to a larger moral order.  Contrast that with the modern emphasis on personal branding and hustle culture. The shift, in a way, mirrors the transition from agricultural to industrial and now post-industrial societies, with a corresponding rise in individualism.

This change isn't just about economics, though.  It's also about a shift in the perceived relationship between agency and fate.  The "opportunities will come to me" mentality often echoes a belief in a preordained path, a sort of cosmic lottery [Does Believing in Fate Facilitate Active or Avoidant Coping?

This echoes the existentialist philosophy, where individuals are fundamentally responsible for creating their own meaning and values.

From a psychological perspective, the shift might also reflect a changing understanding of self-efficacy. Are we more aware of our capabilities and our ability to influence our circumstances? Or is it a more complex interplay of factors, including social pressures, advertising, and media portrayals of success? Consider the concept of learned helplessness – if one consistently fails to achieve their goals, does this foster a sense of resignation or an even stronger drive to achieve?

The "I need to get what I want" approach also raises philosophical questions.  What does it mean to truly "want" something?  Is it a reflection of genuine desires, or a manifestation of societal pressures or internalized expectations?  We see this in consumerism, where desires are often manufactured and constantly shifting.  Is this a healthy evolution, or a form of manufactured dissatisfaction?

And what about the potential downsides of this shift?  Does the relentless pursuit of personal gain lead to burnout, alienation, and a sense of disconnection from others? Does it erode the importance of community and shared experiences?   Do we risk losing sight of things that truly matter, like compassion, creativity, or simply the joy of the journey?  Perhaps the ideal balance lies somewhere in the middle, in finding a way to pursue our aspirations while maintaining a sense of connection to something larger than ourselves.

Ultimately, it seems that the answer is not a simple yes or no.  The world is changing, and the interplay between these two perspectives – passivity and activity, acceptance and ambition – remains a complex and ongoing narrative.  What are your thoughts on how this shift might play out in the future? How can we navigate this evolving landscape in a way that maximizes our potential while fostering well-being and meaning?
