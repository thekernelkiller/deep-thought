It's an intriguing question, isn't it?  The shift from a passive, almost mystical, "opportunities will come to me" mentality to a more proactive, "I need to get what I want" approach.  It feels like a fundamental shift in human psychology, perhaps even a cultural paradigm shift.

Think about the stoic philosophers[1].  They emphasized virtue and living in accordance with nature, often advocating for acceptance of what comes.  This aligns with the "opportunities will come to me" mindset.  It's a bit like accepting the flow of a river; you don't fight the current, you learn to navigate it effectively.  But our modern world, with its emphasis on individual agency and achievement, feels very different. We're driven by ambition, by a desire for tangible results.  This "I need to get what I want" mentality reflects a different kind of relationship with the world, one perhaps more akin to engineering than acceptance.

The Bhagavad Gita[2], in its own way, touches upon this duality.  Arjuna, faced with the impending battle, is paralyzed by inaction.  He is overwhelmed by the potential consequences.  Krishna's teachings, however, are not about passively waiting for opportunities, but about understanding one's dharma, one's duty, and acting in accordance with it.  It's not a simple "get what you want" philosophy, but a nuanced approach that emphasizes responsibility and purpose. The crucial difference is action guided by principle, not just by desire.

This shift also resonates with the concept of "flow" in psychology[3].  Csikszentmihalyi's work highlights the importance of engagement and challenge. A person in a state of flow is not passively waiting for opportunities, but actively pursuing something they find meaningful. In this sense, the "I need to get what I want" approach, if channeled correctly, can lead to a fulfilling state of flow. However, driven by pure ego, it could lead to a relentless pursuit of gratification, potentially lacking the depth and meaning that comes from a sense of purpose.

The "opportunities will come to me" mentality, while seemingly passive, can also be interpreted as a result of a deep trust in one's inherent worth and the universe's unfolding design. It's a faith-based approach, relying on a certain understanding of fate or destiny. This could be seen as an optimistic, perhaps even spiritual, perspective. On the other hand, the "I need to get what I want" mentality, while proactive, can be overly focused on the external world and its material rewards.

So, is this a good or bad shift?  There's no easy answer.  The question is, are we simply becoming more pragmatic or are we losing something essential in the process? Are we becoming more efficient but less fulfilled? Are we neglecting the importance of serendipity and chance encounters that might lead to unexpected opportunities and profound insights? [4]

Ultimately, it's not about one mentality being inherently better than the other.  Perhaps the most valuable perspective is to find a balance between these two approaches, combining a proactive drive with a sense of acceptance and trust. What do you think? What are your thoughts on this?  How can we find this balance in our own lives?
