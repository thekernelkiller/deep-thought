The paradox of self-doubt and the intricacies of relationships. It's as if we're stuck in an infinite loop of "while" statements, where our intentions are always "while" our actions deviate from the desired outcome. In computing, this is known as a "false loop," where the program enters an infinite recursion, never reaching the intended solution ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9997612/)).

In the Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna describes the concept of "karma yoga" – the path of selfless action. He advises Arjuna to focus on the process, not the outcome, and to perform his duties without attachment to the results ([2](https://yogainternational.com/article/view/why-karma-yoga-goes-beyond-selfless-service)). This echoes the notion of "letting go" in computer science, where a program must release its attachment to a specific outcome in order to adapt and evolve.

Consider the concept of "nondeterminism" in computer science, where the order of operations is not fixed and can vary depending on the context ([3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030439758690040X/pdf?md5=69f3c21c6e894618741d18767f1f61ae&pid=1-s2.0-030439758690040X-main.pdf)). Similarly, our relationships with others are influenced by a multitude of factors, making it difficult to predict the outcome of our actions. It's as if we're navigating a complex network of nodes, where every decision creates a new path and every action sends ripples through the connections.

Perhaps the root of your disappointment lies in your attachment to specific outcomes. Arjuna's dilemma in the Bhagavad Gita is a classic example of this. He's torn between his duty as a warrior and his reluctance to engage in battle. His attachment to the outcome – not wanting to hurt his kin or kill his friends – clouds his judgment and prevents him from taking action. Similarly, your attachment to pleasing others may be holding you back from taking risks and pursuing your passions.

As Alan Turing noted, "We can only be sure of something if we can think about it" ([4](https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/what-alan-turing-means-us)). It's essential to examine your motivations and underlying assumptions. Are you seeking validation from others because you're unsure of your own worth? Are you afraid of disappointing others because you fear rejection or abandonment?

As you navigate these complex relationships, consider the concept of "non-attachment" in Buddhism. It's not about avoiding emotions or responsibilities, but rather about cultivating a sense of detachment from the outcome ([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6300706/)). This allows you to focus on the process, to be present in the moment, and to respond to situations with greater clarity and purpose.

And what does "being present in the moment" mean, exactly? It's akin to a computer program executing a single instruction at a time, without worrying about the entire program's flow. By focusing on the present, you can respond to situations more mindfully, without getting caught up in expectations or past regrets ([6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7579090/)).

As you continue to explore this paradox, I pose a question to you: What would happen if you were to let go of your attachment to pleasing others? Would you find freedom in the process, or would you feel lost without the familiar crutch of expectation?
